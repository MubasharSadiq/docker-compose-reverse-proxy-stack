# docker-compose-reverse-proxy-stack
This project demonstrates a multi-container Docker setup using Docker Compose, designed to host and manage multiple services behind a reverse proxy. It includes WordPress, MySQL, Nginx, a Flask application, and a Node.js application. The reverse proxy, powered by Nginx, routes traffic to the appropriate services based on the request paths.
